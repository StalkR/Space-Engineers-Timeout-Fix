The plugin was originally written by Space Engineers community member _rexxar_
and released on [reddit][reddit] with the source.

Later versions of the plugin were distributed in binary form (dll) among the
Space Engineers community but, to our knowledge, without source.
The purpose of this repository is to present the source of the latest known
version of the plugin, for [inclusion][pluginhub-def] in the
[Plugin Hub][pluginhub] of [Plugin Loader][pluginloader].
